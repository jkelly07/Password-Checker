Locjk
Locjk is an application that helps users develop safe and strong passwords. The application was created by Jaden Kelly as part of his Year 11 Software Engineering second Assessment Task.

How it works
The application allows you to type in a password. This password is then rated out of 100 based on certain criterias, and this rating is shown on a progress bar.

Installation
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/jkelly07/Password-Checker
2. Navigate to the cloned repository
3. Run the application: Locjk.py
